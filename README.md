Kinect Angle tools
======================================================================
These angle tools have been being used a lot in most of my repos and 
they get changed in one and not updated in the others. I figured they deserve their
own repo so that the changes automatically propogate. 


Dependencies
============

There's no direct dependencies but the angle calculator requires that
the data is in the json format and the json converter requires
a tuple of the form ([[name, [x, y, z], [x, y, z, w]]], optionalTime)
